# WHERE
> SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition

NOTE : not equal is <> in SQL

__multiple conditions with AND/OR__
> SELECT column FROM table WHERE condition1 AND/OR condition2 AND/OR condition3 ...  
> SELECT column FROM table WHERE (condition1 OR condition) AND (condition3 OR condition4)

__for range values, use BETWEEN__
> SELECT column FROM table WHERE column BETWEEN a AND b

__too many conditions, use WHERE IN__
> SELECT column FROM table WHERE column IN (con1,con2,con3,con4)

## Missing Value : __IS NULL__, __IS NOT NULL__
__count the missing value__
> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table WHERE column IS NULL  
> SELECT column FROM table WHERE column IS NULL

## String Pattern : __LIKE__, __NOT LIKE__

__% will match 0, 1 or many character in string__
> SELECT column FROM table WHERE column LIKE '%a'

_ __will match 1 character in string__
> SELECT column FROM table WHERE column LIKE '_a'
