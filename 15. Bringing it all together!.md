# Welcome to the Case Study

## __Recap__

## zip
>z = zip(list, list2)
NOTE : turn into list to print out  
## define a function
>def function(arg1,arg2):
function body
return result

## List comprehension

### Basic
>[i for i in iterable]

### Advanced
>[i if condition on __output__ for i in iterable if condition on __iterable__]

condition on output can seved as filter  
condition on iterable can served as different output

### print head of DataFrame
>print(df.DataFrame())

# Using Python generators for streming data

### Generators for the large data limit
- use a generator to load a file line by line
- works on streaming data!
- read and process the file until all lines are exhausted

### open file
> with open(filename) as file

### Skip the column names
> file.readline()

### read file generator
>def read_large_file(file_object):  
    """A generator function to read a large file lazily."""

    Loop indefinitely until the end of the file
    while True:

     # Read a line from the file: data
        data = file_object.readline()

     # Break if this is the end of the file
        if not data:
            break

    # Yield the line of data
        yield data
        

# Using iterators for streaming data

### Reading files in chunks
- read_csv() function and chunksize argument
- look as specific indicators in specific countries
- write a function to generalize tasks
