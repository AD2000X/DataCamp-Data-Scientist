## Null hypothesis
- the click-through rate is not affected by the redesign

__Permutation test of clicks through__
> import numpy as np #clickthrough_A, clickthrough_B: arr. of 1s and 0s.  
> def diff_frac(data_A, data_B):  
> frac_A = np.sum(data_A)/ len(data_A)  
> frac_B = np.sum(data_A)/ len(data_B)  
> return frac_B - frac_A  
> diff_frac_obs = diff_frac(clickthrough_A, clickthrough_B)

> perm_replicates = np.empty(10000)  
> for i in range(10000):  
> perm_replicates[i] = permutation_replicate(clickthrough_A, clickthrough_B, diff_frac)  
> p_value = np.sum(erm_replicates >= diff_frac_obs) / 10000  
> p_value = 0.016

## A/B test
- used by organizations to see if a strategy change gives a better result.
## Null hypothesis of an A/B test
- the test statistic is impervious(unaffected, immune) to the change.

# Test of correlation
## Hypothesis test of correlation
- posit null hypothesis: the two variables are completely uncorrelated
- simulate data assuming null hypothesis is true
- use pearson correlation, $\rho$, as test statistic
- compute p-value as fraction of replicates that have $\rho$ at least as large as observed
