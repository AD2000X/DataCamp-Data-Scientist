# Probability density functions
## Continuous variables
- Quantities that can take any value, not just discrete value.

## Probability density function (PDF)
- continuous analog to the PMF
- mathematical description of the relative likelihood of observing a value of a continuous variable

# Introduction to the Normal distribution
- describes a continuous variable whose PDF has a single symmetric peak.

## Parameter $\neq$ Calculated from data
- mean of a normal distribution $\neq$ mean computed from data
- standard deviation of a normal distribution $\neq$ standard deviation computed from data

# The Normal Distribution: Properties and warnings
a.k.a. Gaussian Distribution

# the Exponential distribution
- the waiting time between arrivals of a Poisson process is Exponentially distributed

## possible Poisson process
- nuclear incidents: 
  - timing of one is independent of all others

__exponential inter-incident times__
> mean = np.mean(inter_times)  
> samples = np.random.exponential(mean, size = 10000)# mean and size  
> x, y = ecdf(inter_times)  
> x_theor, y_theor = ecdf(samples)  
> _ = plt.plot(x_theor, y_theor)  
> _ = plt.plot(x,y, marker = '.', linestyle = 'none')  
> _ = plt.xlabel('time')  
> _ = plt.ylabel('CDF')  
> plt.show()

# Final Thoughts
## now can...
- construct(beautiful) instructive plots
- compute informative summary statistics
- use hacker statistics
- think probabilistically

## in the sequel, will...
- estimate parameter values
- perform linear regressions
- compute confidence intervals
- perform hypothesis tests
