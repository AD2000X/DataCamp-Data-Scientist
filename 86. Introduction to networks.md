# Introduction to networks
## Networks!
- Examples:
  - social
  - transportation
- model relationships between entities
- insights:
  - important entities: influencers in social network
  - pathfinding: most efficient transport path
  - clustering: finding communities

## NetworkX API basics
> import networkx as nx  
> G = nx.Graph()  
> G.add_nodes_from([1,2,3])  
> G.nodes()  
> [out] [1,2,3]  
> G.add_edge(1,2)  
> G.edge()  
> [out] [(1,2)]

> G.node[1]['label'] = 'blue'  
> G.nodes(data = True)  
> [out] [(1, {'label': 'blue'}), (2, {}), (3, {})]

> nx.draw(G)  
> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
> plt.show()

## NOTE
- G.node, G.edge to view
- G.add_nodes_from, G.add_edge to add

# Types of graphs

## Undirected graphs
- facebook social graph

> import networkx as nx  
> G = nx.Graph()  
> type(G)  
> [out] networkx.classes.graph.Graph

## Directed graphs
- directed: Twitter social graph

> D = nx.DiGraph()  
> type(D)  
> [out] networkx.classes.digraph.DiGraph

## Mulit(Di)Graph: trip records between bike sharing stations
__multi-edge(Directed)Graphs__
> M = nx.MultiGraph()  
> type(M)  
> networkx.classes.multigraph.MultiGraph  
> MD = nx.MultiDiGraph()  
> type(MD)  
> [out] networkx.classes.multidigraph.MulDiGraph

## Weights on graphs
- edges can contain weights

## Self-loops
- nodes that are connected to themselves

# Network visualization
## Visualizing networks
- matrix plots
- arc plots
- circos plots

__nxviz API__
> import nxviz as nv  
> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
> ap = nv.ArcPlot(G)  
> ap.draw()  
> plt.show()
