# Cliques & communities
## Cliques
- social cliques: tightly-knit groups
- network cliques: completely connected graphs
- simplest complex clique: a triangle

## Triangle applications
- friend recommendation systems

__Clique code__

# Maximal cliques
## Maximal cliques
- definition: a clique that, when extended by one node is no longer a clique
- Applications: community finding

## Communities
- find cliques
- find union of cliques

## NetworkX API
- find_cliques find all miximal cliques

__Maximal cliques__
> import networkx as nx  
> G = nx.barbell_graph(m1 = 5, m2 = 1)  
> nx.find_cliques(G)  
> list(nx.find_cliques(G))

# Subgraphs
- visualize protions of a large graph
  - paths
  - communities/cliques
  - degree of separation from a node

__subgraphs__
> import networkx as nx  
> G = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(n = 20, p = 0.2)  
> G.nodes()  
> [out] [0,1,2,3,4,5...]  
> nodes = G.neighbors(8)  
> nodes  
> [out] [2,3,4,20]  
> nodes.append(8)

> G_eight = G.subgraph(nodes)  
> G_eight.edges()  
> G_eight  
> G  

> nx.draw(G_eight, with_labels = True)
