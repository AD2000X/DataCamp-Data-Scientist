# Case study!
## Data
- Github user collaboration network
- nodes: users
- edges: collaboration on same Github repository
- goals:
  - analyze structure
  - visualize
  - build simple recommendation system

__graph properties__
> import networkx as nx  
> G = nx.erdo_renyi_graph(n = 20, p = 0.2)  
> len(G.edges())  
> [out]29  
> len(G.nodes())  
> [out]20

> nx.degree_centrality(G)  
> nx.betweenness_centrality(G)

## Data
- number of nodes
- number of edges
- degree centrality distribution
- betweenness centrality distribution

# Visualization
__nxviz API__
> import networkx as nx  
> import nxviz as nz  
> G = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(n = 20, p = 0.3)  
> circ = nv.CircoPlot(G, node_color = 'key', node_group = 'key')  
> circ.draw()

__NetworkX API__
> import networks as nx  
> G = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(n = 100, p = 0.03)  
> nx.connected_component_subgraphs(G)  
> list(nx.connected_component_subgraphs(G))  
> for g in list(nx.connected_component_subgraphs(G)):  
> print(len(g.nodes()))  
> [out] 99  
> 1

# Cliques
- definition:
  - groups of nodes
  - fully connected
- simplest clique: edge
- simplest complex clique: triangle

## Maximal cliques
- definition:
  - a clique
  - cannot be extended by adding a node

__finding cliques__
> import networkx as nx  
> G = nx.erdos_renyi_graph(n = 100, p = 0.15)  
> nx.find_cliques(G)  
> for clique in nx.find_cliques(G)  
> print(len(clique))

# Final tasks
- find important users
  - degree centrality
- find largest communities of callaborators
  - maximal clique
- build a collaboration recommendation system
  - open triangle
