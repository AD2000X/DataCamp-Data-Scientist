# Concatenating data

## Combining data
- ata may not always come in 1 huge file
  - may be broken into separate datasets
  - easier to store and share
  - may have new data for each day
- important to be able to combine then clean, or vice versa.

[__pandas concat__](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.4/generated/pandas.concat.html)
> pd.concat[table1, table2]

default = row concat  
axit = 1 means column concat

this will produce duplicate index  
use ignore_index to fix it.
>pd.concat([table1, table2], ignore_index = True)

# Finding and concatenating data

- in order to concatenate DataFrames:
  - they must be in a list
  - can individually load if there are a few datasets

## __Problem__ : there are thousands of datasets  
## __Solution__ : use __glob__ and __loop__ to do it!

## Globbing
- pattern matching for file names
- wildcards: * ?
  - any csv file: *.csv
  - any single character : file_?.csv
- return a list of file names
- can use this list to load into separate DataFrames

## Step
1. load files from globbing into pandas
2. add the DataFrames into a list
3. concatenate multiple datasets at once

__find files and concatenate__
>import glob  
>csv_files = glob.glob('*.csv')  

__using loops__
>list_data = []  
> for filename in csv_files:  
> data = pd.read_csv(filename)  
> list_data.append(data)  
>pd.concat(list_data)

# Merge data
[Documentation JOIN, MERGE and CONCAT](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/merging.html)
- concatenation is not the only way data can be combined
- merging data is similar to __joining tables__ in SQL
- combine disparate datasets __based on common column (aka KEY)__

>pd.merge(left = DataFrame1, right = DataFrame2, left_on = key1, right_on = key2, on = None)

if two key columns has same names, on = True and don't need to specific left_on and right_on

on: Column or index level names to join on.

## Types of merges
- one-to-one
- many-to-one / one-to-many
- many-to-many

## Different types of merges
- all use the same function
- only difference is the DataFrames you are merging
