# Formulating and simulating hypotheses
## Hypothesis testing
- assessment of how resonable the observed data are assuming a hypothesis is true
## Null hypothesis
- another name for the hypothesis you are testing
## Permutation
- random reordering of entries in an array
- simulating a null hypothesis when assuming two quantities are identically distributed.

__Generating a permutation sample__
> import numpy as np  
> dem_share_both = np.concatenate((dem_share_PA, dem_share_OH)) #use tuple for np.concatenate  
> dem_share_perm = np.random.permutation(dem_share_both)  
> per_sample_PA = dem_share_perm[:len(dem_share_PA)]  
> per_sample_OH = dem_share_perm[len(dem_share_PA):]

# Test statistics and p-values
## Hypothesis tesing
- assessment of how resonable the observed data are assuming a hypothesis is true
## Test statistic
- a single number the can be computed from observed data and from data you simulate under the null hypothesis
- it serves as a basis of comparison between the two

__permutation replicate__
> np.mean(perm_sample_PA) - np.mean(perm_sample_OH)  
> [out] 1.122
> np.mean(dem_share_PA) - np.mean(dem_share_OH)  
> [out] 1.158

__p-value__
- the probability of obtaining a value of your test statistic that is at least as extreme as what was observed, under the assumption the null hypothesis is true.
- __NOT__ the probability that the null hypothesis is true.

## Statistical significance
- determined by the smallness of a p-value

## Null hypothesis significance testing(NHST)
- another name for what we are doing in this chapter.

## statistical significance $\neq$ pratical significance

# Bootstrap hypothesis tests
## Pipeline for hypothesis testing
- clearly state the null hypothesis
- define your test statistic
- generate many sets of simulated data assuming the null hypothesis is true
- compute the test statistic for each simulated data set
- the p-value is the fraction of your simulated data set for wich the test statistics is at least as extreme as for the real data
  
## Null hypothesis
- the true mean seed of light in Michelson's experiments was actually Newcomb's reported value

__shifting the Michelson data__
> newcomb_value = 299860  
> michelson_shifted = michelson_speed_of_light - np.mean(michelson_speed_of_light) + newcomb_value

__calculating the test statistic__
> def diff_from_newcomb(data, newcomb_value = 299869)  
> return np.mean(data) - newcomb_value  
> diff_obs = diff_from_newcomb(michelson_speed_of_light)  
> diff_obs = -7.599

__one sample test__
- compare one set of data to a single number

__two sample test__
- compare two sets of data
