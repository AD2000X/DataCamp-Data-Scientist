# Do the genders commit different violations?
## counting unique values
- value_counts(): count the unique values in a Series
- best suited for categorical data

> ri.stop_outcome.value_counts()
> [out] ...  
> ri.stop_coutcome.value_counts().sum()  
> [out] 86536  
> ri.shape  
> [out] (86536, 13)

## Expressing counts as proportions
> ri.stop_outcome.value_counts()  
> [out] ...

> ri.stop_outcome.value_counts(normalize = True)

## Filtering DataFrame rows
> ri.driver_race.value_counts()  
> white = ri[ri.driver_race == 'White']  
> white.shape  
> (61870, 13)

## Comparing stop outcomes for two groups
> white.stop_outcome.value_counts(normalize = True)  
> asian = ri[ri.driver_race == 'Asian']  
> asian.stop_outcome.value_counts(normalizer = True)

# Does gender affect who gets a ticket for speeding?
## Filtering by multiple conditions(1)
> female = ri[ri.driver_gender == 'F]  
> female.shape  
> [out] (23774, 13)  
> female_and_arrest = ri[ri.driver_gender == 'F' & (ri.is_arrested == True)]  

- each condition is surrounded by parenthesses
- ampersand(&) represents the and operator

> female and_arrested.shape  
> [out] (669,13)

- only includes female drivers who were arrested

## Filtering by multiple conditions(2)
> female_or_arrested = ri[ri.driver_gender == 'F' | (ri.is_arrested == True)]
- Pipe(|) represent the or operator

> female_or_arrested.shape  
> [out] (26103, 13)
- includes all females
- includes all drivers who were arrested

## Rules for filtering by multiple conditions
- ampresand(&): only include rows that satisfy both conditions
- Pipe(|): include rows that satisfy either condition
- each condition must be surrounded by parentheses
- conditions can check for equality (==),inequality(!=), etc.
- can use more than two conditions

## Correlation, not causation
- analyze the relationship between gender and stop outcome
  - assess whether there is a correlation
- not going to draw any conclusions about causation
  - would need additional data and expertise
  - exploring relationships only

# Does gender affect whose vehicle is searched?
## Math with Boolean values
> ri.isnull().sum()  
> [out] ...
- True = 1, False = 0

> import numpy as np  
> np.mean([0, 1, 0, 0])  
> [out] 0.25  
> np.mean([False, True, False, False])  
> [out] 0.25
- mean of boolean Series represents percentage of True values

## Taking the mean of a Boolean Series
> ri.is_arrested.value_count(normalize = True)  
> [out] False 0.96  
> True 0.04  
> Name: is_arrested, dtype: float64

> ri.is_arrested.mean()  
> [out] 0.0355

> ri.is_arrested.dtype  
> [out] dtype ('bool')

## comparing groups using groupby
- study the arrest rate by police district
> ri.district.unique()  
> [out] ...
> ri[ri.district == 'Zone K1'].is_arrested.mean()  
> 0.02  
> ri[ri.district == 'Zone K2'].is_arrested.mean()  
> 0.03  
> ri.groupby('district').is_arrested.mean()  
> [out] ...

## Grouping by multiple categories
> ri.groupby(['district', 'driver_gender']).is_arrested.mean()  
> [out] ...

> ri.groupby(['driver_gender', 'district']).is_arrested.mean()
> [out] ...

# Does gender affect who is frisked during a search?
## Examining the search types(1)
> ri.search_conducted.value_counts()  
> [out]  
> False 83229  
> True 3307

> ri.search_type.value_counts(dropna = False)  
> [out]  
> NaN 83229  
> Incident to Arrest 1290  
> Incident to arrest , Inventory 219  
> ...

- value_counts() excludes missing values by default
- dropna = False displays missing values

## Examining the search types(2)
> ri.search_type.value_counts()  
> incident to arrest 1290  
> ...
- multiple values are separated by commas
- 219 searches in which 'inventory' was the only search type
- locate 'inventory' among multiple search types

## Search for a string
> ri['inventory'] = ri.search_type.str.contains('Inventory', na = False)
- str.contains() returns True if string is found, False if not found
- na = False returns False when it finds a missing value

> ri.inventory.dtype  
> dtype('bool')
- True means an inventory was done, False means it was not  
> ri.inventory.sum()  
> 441

## Calculating the inventory rate
> ri.inventory.mean()  
> 0.005  
- 0.5% of all traffic stops resulted in an inventory

> searched = ri[ri.search_conducted == True]  
> searched.inventory.mean()  
> [out] 0.1333
- 13.3% of searches included an inventory
