# Visualizing hierarchies
## Visualisations communicate insight
- 't-SNE': creates a 2D map of a dataset(later)
- 'Hierarchical clustering' (this video)

## A hierarchy of groups
- groups of living things can form a hierarchy
- clusters are contained in one another

## Eurovision scoring dataset
- countries gave scores to songs performed at the Eurovision 2016
- 2D array of scores
- rows are countries, column are songs

## Hierarchical clustering
- every country begins in a separate cluster
- at each step, the two closest clusters are merged
- continue until all countries in a single cluster
- this is 'agglomerative' hierarchical clustering

## the dendrogram of a hierarchical clustering
- read from the bottom up
- vertical lines represent clusters

__Hierarchical clustering with SciPy__
- given samples(the array of scores), and country_names
