# Dictionaries, Part 1

list.index("keyword") will return the index number  
dict["key"] will return the value  
- key-value pair

dict.keys() will return all keys  
dict.values() will return all keys


# Dictionaries, Part 2

keyword in dict will return boolean  
del(dict["key"] will remove key and values


__difference of list and dictionary__

List: Index by range of number, order matters,select entire subsets.  
Dict: Index by unique keys,lookup with unique keys

Add new key and value  
dict[new_key] = 'new_value'  


Adding two same key will display last one(meaning update), but contain both in dict.


### List can contain list, dict can contain dict
to access dict in dict, use multiple [ ][ ]  
- also for adding

## Key is immutable, List is mutable
