# Introduction to other file types

## __Other file types__
 1. pickle file (pickle)
 2. excel spreadsheets (pandas)
 3. SAS files (pandas)
 4. Stata files (pandas)
 5. HDF5 files
 6. MATLAB files


## 1. Pickle file

- file type native to Python
- Motivation : many datatypes for which it isn't obvious how to store them (ex : list, dict)  
- pickled file are serialized
- serialize = convert object to bytestream, not human readable, but computer readable.
rb = read binary  
wb = write binary

with open  
pickle.load()

>import pickle
with open('file.pkl', 'rb') as file:  
data = pickle.load(file)

## 2. Excel spreadsheets
pd.ExcelFile(file)  

>import pandas as pd  
data = pd.ExcelFile(file)  

To know the sheets name  
data.sheet_names  
data.parse('sheetname')   
or data.parse('index number')'to access sheet


>print(data.sheet_name)
sheet = data.parse('sheetname')

skip rows and rename column  
__NOTE : USE LIST__ 
>df1 = xl.parse(0, skiprows=[1], names=['Country','AAM due to War (2002)'])


## 3. SAS
- SAS = statistical analysis system
- Business analytic and biostatistics
- Used for 
    - advanced analytics 
    - multivariate analysis
    - business intelligence
    - data management
    - predictive analytics
- Standard for computational analysis


__importing SAS files__
> import pandas as pd  
> from sas7bdat import SAS7BDAT  
> with SAS7BDAT('filename') as file:  
> df_sas = file.to_data_frame()



## 4. Stata

- stata = Statistics + data
- academic social science research

__import stata files__
>import pandas  
data = pd.read_stata('filename')
