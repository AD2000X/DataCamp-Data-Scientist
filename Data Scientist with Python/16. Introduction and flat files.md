## reading a text file
>filename = 'file.txt'  
file = open(filename, mode = 'r' or 'w')  
#depend on read or write   
text = file.read()  
file.close  

NOTE: read, readline and close are method
open are function

## Comtext Manager 'with'
> with open('filename', 'r') as file:  
> print(file.read())


# The importance of flat files in data science

flat files is table data without structure relationships.

Rows : record  
Column : feature or attribute

Header : first row that describe the content of the data column.  

CSV = comma separated value.  
txt = text file  
comma, tabs = delimiters  


Import data by two main packages : 
- NumPy for numpy array.
- pandas for data frame


# Importing flat files using NumPy

## __np.loadtxt(filename, delimiter = ',', skiprows = 1, usecols = [0,2], dtype = str)__

tab delimiter = '\t'
when first row is header, skiprows = 1  
usecols = only use those column  
dtype = str will imoprt all entry as string  
loadtxt is convenient for basic use,   
## __but will have problem with mixed datatypes__  
## Use __np.genfromtxt(dtype = None)__  
This function will figure datatypes of each column  
use np.shape(data) to get the shape of data

>data = np.genfromtxt('titanic.csv', delimiter=',', names=True, dtype=None)

names = True means ther is a header

## __np.recfromcsv()__ 
- same as genfromtxt() but dtype is default as None
- default delimiter=','
- default names = True

# Importing flat files using pandas
>pd.read_csv(filename, nrows = number of rows, header = True or none, na_values= 'NA')  

To check the header and first 5 observations
>data.head()

Trans DataFrame to numpy array.
> data = data.values

__What a data scientist needs__
- Two-dimensional labeled data structure
- column of potentially different types
- manipulate, slice, reshape, groupny, join, merge
- perform statistics
- work with time series data

DataFrame = pythonic analog of R's data frame  


### __A matrix has rows and columns. A data frame has observations and variables.__
