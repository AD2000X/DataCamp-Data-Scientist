# Degree centrality
## Important nodes
- which nodes are important?
  - degree centrality
  - betweeness centrality

## Degree centrality
- Definition:
  - $\frac{number\,of\,neighbours\,i\,have}{number\,of\,neighbours\,i\,could\,possibly\,have}$


- examples of nodes with high degree centrality:
  - twitter broadcasters
  - airport transportation hubs
  - disease super-spreaders

__number of neighbors__
> G.edges()  
> G.neighbors(1)  
> [out] node 1's neighbors  

__Degree centrality__
> nx.degree_centrality(G)  
> [out] each node's degree centrality

# Graph algorithms
## Finding paths
- pathfinding is important for
  - optimization: e.g. shortest transport paths
  - modeling: e.g. disease spread, information passing
- algorithm: breadth-first search

## Breadth-first search(BFS)
- example: shortest path between two nodes

__Recall: neighbors__
> G  
> len(G.edges())  
> len(G.nodes())  
> G.neighbors(1)  
> G.neighbors(10)  

# Betweenness centrality
## all shortest paths
- set of paths
- each path is shortest path between a given pair of nodes
- done for all node pairs

## Betweenness centrality
- Definition:
  - $\frac{number\,of\,shortest\,paths\,through\,node}{all\,possible\,shortest\,paths}$
- Application:
  - bridges between liberal-and conservative-leaning Twitter users
  - critical information transfer links

__Betweenness centrality__
> import networkx as nx  
> G = nx.barbell_graph(m1 = 5, m2 = 1)  
> nx.betweenness_centrality(G)  
> [out] ...
